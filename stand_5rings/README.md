## A stand for five nested rings

This is the default hardware for the demo in the repo root.

## Bowl: an accident.
The translucen bowl I am illuminating here is, in fact, the result of a monumental cock-up on my part where I melted a bearly-new reel of translucent PETG, rather than de-humidifying it. :upset: I eventually lined a big flan dish and melted the whole mess down (minus the cardboard spool bits) into the solid lump you see here.

The resulting lump of PETG is rather nice, very hard and glossy, but not food safe, there are still some minute holes and cracks in the surface if you look closely. It would make a good fruit bowl os similar.

## Stand: not accidental.
The main stand is cut from 3mm plywood, glued and painted. The plans for this are in `ringstand.scad`, and the resulting paths for lasercutting etc. are in `ringstand.svg`

The feet for the stand are in `ringstand-feet.scad`, and `ringstand-feet.stl` has the model files.

The rings are lightly glued to the standoff pieces, the plastic 'cover' on them is to prevent dust buildup, and was cut from a lid of a plastic tub of Haribo sweets..

WIP.. I'll post more as I do more.
